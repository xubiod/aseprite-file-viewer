# Aseprite File Viewer

An Aseprite file/project viewer made entirely in Godot.

Builds and more information are available on the [itch page](https://xubiod.itch.io/aseprite-file-viewer).

The structure of the source code is a bit of a mess, still learning Godot and how
I want to organize a project with it internally.
